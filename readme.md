# BetterEXP

**BetterEXP** is a Lethal Company mod looking to spice up the current experience system in the game. Right now the XP system feels a bit clunky and not a good (enough) measure of a player's true experience working for The Company, so I've created BetterEXP to hopefully make the XP system feel much more satisfying and rewarding/punishing, depending on your actions. This is a **client-sided** mod, meaning nobody else needs it for it to work! BetterEXP functions perfectly in completely vanilla lobbies. See the [Thunderstore page](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Swaggies/BetterEXP/) for downloads.
